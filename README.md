## High-Throughput Image Analysis and Statistical Pipeline for Quantifying Condensates

**CondenScreen** is a robust, open-source pipeline developed to analyze condensate phenotypes in immunofluorescence images. Developed by the Schlieker Lab, the program leverages [CellProfiler 4.2.8](https://cellprofiler.org/) for image segmentation and R for statistical analysis.

## Overview

This repository includes:

- A **CellProfiler pipeline** to quantify & segment condensate foci/puncta into single cells
- A **Bash script** to batch-process image sets across a computing cluster (in this case Yale's YCRC)
- An **R script** for statistical analysis of foci, cell count, and screen-wide normalization using Z-, B-, and BZ-scores, depending on indication.
- A Graphical User Interface allowing well-selection and automated code alterations depending on if screen had a signal-ON vs signal-OFF readout.
- Tools for hit identification & automated data visualization output.

Originally developed to analyze MLF2-GFP foci, the pipeline can be adapted for other foci types and imaging setups.

## CellProfiler Image Segmentation Pipeline

We designed a custom image segmentation workflow in CellProfiler 4.2.8:

- **Nuclei Detection**
  - Identified using shape constraints (30–100 pixels)
  - Segmented via *adaptive Minimum Cross-Entropy thresholding* (0.1–1.0)

- **Cytoplasm & Condensate Foci Detection**
  - Enhance foci features to limit background.
  - Foci identified using  *adaptive Otsu thresholding* (0.0175–1.0; 1-10 pixel size)
  - Foci assigned to individual cells via cytoplasm/nuclei mapping
    
- **Quantification of Intensity, Size, & FormFactor**
  - Nuclei (and optionally foci) have their intensity, size, and formfactor, among many additional variables quantified.
  - All foci data are grouped according to parent cell
  - Data and annotated images exported
    
### Cluster Deployment (Optional)

For large-scale screens, we developed a simple batch script for high-throughput processing using SLURM and headless CellProfiler runs:

1. Generate batch files using CellProfiler’s `CreateBatchFiles` module
2. Submit jobs using provided `.sh` script
3. Analyze >1 million `.TIFF` images autonomously within hours (dependent on cluster capabilities)

## R-Based Statistical Analysis (CondenScreen)

The **CondenScreen** R pipeline includes:

- **Plate Parsing**
  - Graphical user interface to assign controls vs test conditions across plates ranging from 6-well --> 384-well.
  - Groups image sets by well using filename string parsing

- **Quantification Metrics**
  - Imports CellProfiler CSV files batching into sets of 20 files/run to limit slow-down
  - Extracts foci/cell and nuclear statistics reported from CellProfiler
  - Nuclei count per image and aggregate count per condition
  - Signal-to-background (SB)
  - Standard deviation (SD)
  - Coefficient of variation (CV)
  - **Z’ score**:
    ```
    Z' = 1 - [3(σ_PosCtrl + σ_NegCtrl) / |μ_PosCtrl - μ_NegCtrl|]
    ```

- **Effect and Significance Calculation**
  - **Percent effect (E%)**:
    ```
    E% = ((x̄ - μ) / μ) * 100
    ```
  - **Z-score**:
    ```
    Z = (E% - μ_E%) / σ_E%
    ```
  - **B-score normalization** (optional):
    - Applies 2-way median polish for intraplate normalization
    - Uses MAD-based normalization:
    ```
    MAD = median(r - median(R))
    ```
  - **Nuclear Health Score**:
    -Applies function to assess deviations in nuclear health relative to control cells
    -Takes into account total number of cells, nuclear area, and morphological changes (form factor)
    ``` 
    Nuclear Health = ∆(Cell Count) + ((100 + ∆(Cell Count)) / 100) ∙ ∑〖(∆Area+ ∆FF)) / 2〗
    ```

  
    
- **Output Includes**
  - Ranked hit lists 
  - Raw and normalized screening distributions
  - Plate heatmaps
  - Z-score/BZ-score plots
    

- **Quality Control**
  - Optionally filters bottom 80% of low-expressing cells to limit either uninduced or non-transfected cells
  - Removes outlier image sets with screening artifacts.

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Required Software

- [Download R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- [Download RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- [Download CellProfiler 4.2.8](https://cellprofiler.org/)

---

## Usage Instructions

### 2. Download Project Files

Download the files listed above into a working directory. Alternatively, clone this repository via:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CondenScreen.git
```

---

### 3. Run the CellProfiler Project

- Launch CellProfiler and load the included `.cpproj` file
- Upload your image set:
  - Images are expected to be grouped in sets of 3 channels (DAPI, GFP, RFP)
  - Adjust this as needed based on your imaging setup
  - ***The downstream R script is programmed to analyze images that are labeled in a format similar to: A19942_B01_s1_w1, where:***
      - The first string segment (A19942) correlates to the plate ID
      - The second segment (B01) correlates to Well Location
      - The third segment (s1) correlates to Image Number within that well
      - The fourth segment (w1) correlates to the Channel of the image.
    - If your labeling pattern is different, you may need to adjust string parsing within R code block #4.
       
- Customize foci identification parameters to suit your experiment
- Test pipeline on sample images and confirm segmentation accuracy
- Update the output/export folder path
- Run the pipeline on all images

---

### 4. Analyze Results in R

- Open `CondenScreen.Rmd` in RStudio
- Ensure `process_batch.R` is located in the same folder

#### First-Time Setup:
- Uncomment lines 13–37 to install required R packages
- Run the **first code block** to load dependencies

#### GUI & Data Input:
- Run the **second code block** to launch a GUI
  - Assign well conditions
  - Indicate whether your screen is signal-ON or signal-OFF
  - Choose output directories

#### Save Location & Optional Metadata:
- Update the `save_Location` variable in the **third code block**
- (Optional) If you have metadata linking drug/gene names to well IDs:
  - Update the **fourth code block**
   
---

### 5. Run the Full Analysis

- Run all code blocks in the R Markdown file
- Output will include:
  - Excel file with rank-ordered hit list
  - Plate overview sheet with Z’-scores, S/B ratios, etc.
  - Per-plate control summaries

- Additional outputs:
  - Z-score and BZ-score plots
  - Raw foci count distributions

### [Optional] Instructions for Running CellProfiler on a Cluster

If processing a large image dataset:
- Upload CPBatch.sh & CondenScreen_CP.cpproj to a new folder within your HPC cluster system
- Customize `CPBatch.sh`:
  - Set correct number of plates and image sets (default: 3024 image sets across 10 plates)
  - Update file paths to match your environment
  - Upload this updated CPBatch.sh file into your newly created folder
- This next part depends on your specific cluster setup. You may need to request access to use CellProfiler on the cluster.
    -Once cellprofiler is installed, activate it and load in pipeline.
    -In our case, once in the correct directory, we used: module load miniconda; conda activate cp4; cellprofiler
- Import raw images to cellprofiler + update paths as required.
- Check "CreateBatchFiles"
- Click "Analyze Images". After a few minutes should get a similar output: "CreateBatchFiles saved pipeline to /home/user_specific/Batch_data.h5
- From command line linked to cluster, navigate to the path where both CPBatch.sh and Batch_data.h5 are located. Run the following command:

```bash
sbatch CPBatch.sh
```

- (optional) Monitor job queue with:
```bash
squeue -u <your_username>
```

- Download the analyzed output files and continue to Step #4.
