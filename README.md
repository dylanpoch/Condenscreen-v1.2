# CondenScreen

## High-Throughput Image Analysis and Statistical Pipeline for Quantifying Condensates

**CondenScreen** is a robust, open-source pipeline developed to analyze condensate phenotypes in immunofluorescence images. Developed by the Schlieker Lab, the program leverages [CellProfiler 4.2.6] for image segmentation and R for statistical analysis. 

---

## Overview

This repository includes:

- A **CellProfiler pipeline** to quantify & segment condensate foci/puncta into single cells
- A **Bash script** to batch-process image sets across a computing cluster (in this case Yale's YCRC)
- An **R script** for statistical analysis of foci, cell count, and screen-wide normalization using Z-, B-, and BZ-scores, depending on indication.
- A trained supervised machine learning approach to characterize distinct condensate phenotypes from microscopy data
- A Graphical User Interface allowing well-selection and automated code alterations depending on if screen had a signal-ON vs signal-OFF readout.
- Tools for hit identification & automated data visualization output.

Originally developed to analyze MLF2-GFP foci, the pipeline can be adapted for other foci types and imaging setups.

## CellProfiler Image Segmentation Pipeline

We designed a custom image segmentation workflow in CellProfiler 4.2.8:

- **Nuclei Detection**
  - Identified using shape constraints (30–100 pixels)
  - Segmented via *adaptive Minimum Cross-Entropy thresholding* (0.1–1.0)

- **Cytoplasm & Condensate Foci Detection**
  - Enhance foci features to limit background.
  - Foci identified using  *adaptive Otsu thresholding* (0.0175–1.0; 1-10 pixel size)
  - Foci assigned to individual cells via cytoplasm/nuclei mapping
    
- **Quantification of Intensity, Size, & FormFactor**
  - Nuclei (and optionally foci) have their intensity, size, and formfactor, among many additional variables quantified.
  - All foci data are grouped according to parent cell
  - Data and annotated images exported

Installation guide
------------------
A. Open locally 
1. Clone the repository:
   - git clone https://github.com/SchliekerLab/Condenscreen-v1.1.git

Typical install time on a "normal" desktop computer: < 5 minutes (clone + open).

B. Run via a simple local server (recommended for some browser features)
1. Clone the repository:
   - git clone https://github.com/SchliekerLab/Condenscreen-v1.1.git
2. Change into the repository directory:
   - cd Condenscreen-v1.1

- Ensure dependencies are installed by referencing `requirementsPy.txt` (python dependencies) and `requirementsR.txt` (R dependencies)
  - Then install dependencies:
    - For python: conda [or pip] install X
    -For R: install.packages(“X”)

Typical install + serve time on a "normal" desktop computer: < 10 minutes.

Instructions to run demo (static web version)
1. Serve the repo as shown above (or open the demo HTML file directly).
2. Navigate to the demo page (e.g., `demo/index.html`) or the main interface.
3. Follow instructions in the associated README.md

--------------------
How to run the software on your data (general guidance)
1. Import raw microscopy images into CellProfiler pipeline (Condenscreen-v1.1/DownloadCondenScreen/CondenScreen.cpproj). Update CellProfiler pipeline to account for your particular data structure (e.g., if only two channels you would remove channel three as it is not needed) and update all pathnames to save to your personal output directory. Update metadata as needed. Configure thresholding and analysis options as indicated.
2. Using the .rmd script (Condenscreen-v1.1/DownloadCondenScreen/ CondenScreenV2.Rmd) and R Script (Condenscreen-v1.1/DownloadCondenScreen/process_batch.R) update path names. Import tabular data that was exported from CellProfiler in step #1.
3. Configure any parameters in the UI and run the analysis.
4. Download/export results and figures. Analysis complete.

Expected outputs
----------------
- Visualizations and downloadable result files (.xlsx / .png or .tif). 
- Rank ordered list of gene or chemical hits.


Reproduction instructions
----------------
